
Differences of 1.1 from 1.0:

1) The x-grid is now saved including all the last 100 points and with 10 significant digits.
2) We ran again the code generating directly the grid, without importing it from an external file. The results reported correspond to this new run.
3) The selection of the points of the grid to be saved has been moved in the section "Input parameters" at the beginning of "Main.cpp".
4) We added a more detailed manual for how to use LePDF, including details on the source code.


Differences of 1.2 from 1.1:

1) Mass thresholds for the charm quark and tau lepton are now also included. These fermions are not present in the DGLAP evolutions for scales smaller than the corresponding mass.
2) The QED coupling evolution is modified accordingly.
3) A section describing these thresholds has been added to the manual.
